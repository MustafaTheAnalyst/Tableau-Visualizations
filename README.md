# Understanding Data with Tableau

I have displayed a few Tableau Dashboard using public datasets below. You can find each Tableau Workbook within the "Workbook" directory in this repo. Feel free to check out images of the dashboards below, and download any workbook that interests you. I also included SQL queries to wrangle the data into the correct representation.

#### Transaction Dashboard

- Workbook Name: Breaking Bread Dashboard
- Dataset: [Bread Basket](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/transactions-from-a-bakery)


This dataset contained transaction information on item purchases from a bakery for six month period in late 2016 and early 2017. I only use the 2017 data to construct a simple dashboard showing us the top item sold from the bakery, the frequency of transaction concerning the time of the day, the total transactions per week in 2017, and a leaderboard of the most common item baskets we see our customer's purchase. This is a really simple dashboard that can be made if you have market basket data with time series information.

#### Crypto Currency Timeline

  - Workbook Name: Crypto Currency Timeline
  - Dataset: [Cryptocurrency Historical Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory)

This dataset contained the volume, market cap, and opening/closing prices of every cryptocurrency coin on a daily basis. The group of visualization above shows the lead-up and the aftermath of the early 2018 crypto currently bubble. We can see a general increase in the number of coins offered on the market before the crash, and a slight reduction after prices started dropping rapidly.


#### Terrorist Attacks and Death Visualization

- Workbook Name: Global Terrorism
- Dataset [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd)

This dataset logs major terrorist attacks across the world. The dataset can tell us the number deaths, wounded, and locations of each terror attack. The visualization above shows the death toll from these attacks per country as an interactive map in Tableau.
